Key:

a word or phrase surrounded by `backquotes` means that it should be interpreted
as a command run on the linux command line, or a line of code in a program source

(?) means optional/"fun fact" info that you might be curious about but isn't
necessary right now.

* surrounding a term means that i'll let you wikipedia it if you want to know more,
or you can ask me. It's something probably worth knowing but is way beyond the
scope of the exercise

Terms enclosed in ``quotes like this'' are specific terms rather than being
merely descriptive or metaphorical. Cmp. A metal pointy stick with ``Broadsword``.

Olivia of course is the best way to learn python, but having additional resources
can't hurt either. I recommend the following:
